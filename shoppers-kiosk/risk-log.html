        <div class="details-text">
            <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Delays:</strong> There is a potential risk of delays in the procurement of specialized materials, which could impact the project timeline.</li>
                <li><strong>On-site Challenges:</strong> Unforeseen challenges during on-site installation, such as electrical issues or measurement discrepancies, could cause delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor Availability:</strong> The availability of carpenters and electicians for installation to be closely watched, requiring careful coordination.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mitigation Plans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Procurement:</strong> To mitigate material delays, all specialized materials will be procured at the earliest possible stage.</li>
                <li><strong>Contingency Planning:</strong> A contingency plan will be in place to address any on-site challenges, including having a backup team of electricians and carpenters on standby.</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor Coordination:</strong> We will work closely with our vendors to ensure timely delivery and installation, with regular follow-ups and a clear communication plan.</li>
